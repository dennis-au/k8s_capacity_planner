# Lab110 KCP Validation Status

Last updated: August 6, 2026

## Milestone 1: Complete

- `lab110` is reachable from the KCP host at `https://192.168.0.110:6443`; unauthenticated requests correctly receive `401`.
- The `lab110` node is `Ready` on Kubernetes `v1.36.3+k3s1`.
- `kcp-reader` has the required read-only access for `/version`, nodes, namespaces, pods, ResourceQuotas, LimitRanges, events, ReplicaSets, and HPAs.
- KCP's collector authenticated with the dedicated reader kubeconfig and returned `v1.36.3+k3s1`.
- `metrics.k8s.io` is currently unavailable. This is a known partial-data condition; it must remain visible in KCP reports and must not be interpreted as zero usage.

## Current Work

Milestone 2: add `lab110` to KCP, select it, and verify the connection test/log workflow.
